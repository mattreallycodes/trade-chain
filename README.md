# Tradechain: A custom blockchain for DeFi, Quant developers designed with latency in mind. 

## Use Cases: 1) Trading Interoperability 2) Lower latency trading 3) Faster TS

### Created using Rust, Substrate 

### Using Nix

Install [nix](https://nixos.org/) and optionally [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) and
[lorri](https://github.com/target/lorri) for a fully plug and play experience for setting up the
development environment. To get all the correct dependencies activate direnv `direnv allow` and
lorri `lorri shell`.

### Rust Setup

First, complete the [basic Rust setup instructions](./docs/rust-setup.md).

### Run

Use Rust's native `cargo` command to build and launch the template node:

```sh
cargo run --release -- --dev
```

### Build

The `cargo run` command will perform an initial build. Use the following command to build the node
without launching it:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

### Embedded Docs

Once the project has been built, the following command can be used to explore all parameters and
subcommands:

```sh
./target/release/node-template -h
```

## Run

The provided `cargo run` command will launch a temporary node and its state will be discarded after
you terminate the process. After the project has been built, there are other ways to launch the
node.

### Single-Node Development Chain

This command will start the single-node development chain with non-persistent state:

```bash
./target/release/node-template --dev
```

Purge the development chain's state:

```bash
./target/release/node-template purge-chain --dev
```

Start the development chain with detailed logging:

```bash
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/release/node-template -ldebug --dev
```

> Development chain means that the state of our chain will be in a tmp folder while the nodes are
> running. Also, **alice** account will be authority and sudo account as declared in the
> [genesis state](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template/blob/main/node/src/chain_spec.rs#L49).
> At the same time the following accounts will be pre-funded:
> - Alice
> - Bob
> - Alice//stash
> - Bob//stash

In case of being interested in maintaining the chain' state between runs a base path must be added
so the db can be stored in the provided folder instead of a temporal one. We could use this folder
to store different chain databases, as a different folder will be created per different chain that
is ran. The following commands shows how to use a newly created folder as our db base path.

```bash
// Create a folder to use as the db base path
$ mkdir my-chain-state

// Use of that folder to store the chain state
$ ./target/release/node-template --dev --base-path ./my-chain-state/

// Check the folder structure created inside the base path after running the chain
$ ls ./my-chain-state
chains
$ ls ./my-chain-state/chains/
dev
$ ls ./my-chain-state/chains/dev
db keystore network

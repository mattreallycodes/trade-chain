# Tradechain Contributor Guidelines üéÅ
Here are some of the ways Tradians can contribute

- Reporting naysayers.(Not really.) 
- Discussing the current state of the code & ecosystem.
- Submitting Code or Leet Hax.(Vulnerabilities or Bugs that affect Tradechain or the Tradechain ecosystem.) 
- Proposing new features, ideas, & constructive critcisms.
- Becoming a Tradian.(Someone who actively contributes as a digital citizen in the Tradechain ecosystem. Matt will share full lore system later.)
- Synergising your efforts with the [Open Source Roadmap](Coming Soon.) This will also be decided on by the community. 

## Why Contribute? üéâ

- Gain future Rewards that we will decide on as a community. 
- Learn & gain XP, improve your Rust skills. 
- Have Fun & Contribute to an Open Source Project with an original creator that is actively creating an enjoyable experience for those who are interested in contributing.
- Network & Meet other developers, these meetings & your open source contributions could lead to future Job & Project opportunities.

## Tradians Develop with Github
Tradians(Contributors) use Github to host code, to track issues, feature requests, & accept pull requests. If there is a better solution, 
feel free to open a community discussion about this using issues.

## Tradechain Uses [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

How to Submit Your Code:

1. Fork the Tradechain repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Use humorous or unique names for your branches(They will know.. more about this in the full lore system.)
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests otherwise according to all superstitions you will suffer greatly.
3. Created detailed commits, don't commit large or even medium sized changes.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache 2.0 Software License
In short, code submissions are licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](./LICENSE) that covers the Tradechain codebase. 
Community discussions around licensing are welcome. 

## Report Leet Hax or Bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/mattreallycodes/trade-chain/issues)
Tradians use GitHub issues to track public bugs or Leet Hax. Report a bug or Leet Hax by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/mattreallycodes/trade-chain/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report a SO user wrote. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background.
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. Here's an example.. [A SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) that includes sample code in R.
- The Expected Behaviour.
- The Actual Behaviour.
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
We are using the following Rust [style guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.12.0/style/).
More style guides for other parts of the codebase will be added in the future. 

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](../LICENSE).
